# Project Euler Problem #65
# The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
# 2 = 1 + 	
# 1
# 
#   	2 + 	
# 1
# 
#   	  	2 + 	
# 1
# 
#   	  	  	2 + 	
# 1
# 
#   	  	  	  	2 + ...
# 
# The infinite continued fraction can be written, 2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, 23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].
# 
# It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for 2.
# 1 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	= 3/2
#   	
# 2
# 	 
# 1 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	= 7/5
#   	2 + 	
# 1
# 
#   	  	
# 2
# 	 
# 1 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	= 17/12
#   	2 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	 
#   	  	2 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	 
#   	  	  	
# 2
# 	 
# 1 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	= 41/29
#   	2 + 	
# 1
# 
#   	  	2 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	 
#   	  	  	2 + 	
# 1
# 
# 	 
#   	  	  	  	
# 2
# 	 
# 
# Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for 2 are:
# 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, ...
# 
# What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
# e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].
# 
# The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
# 2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...
# 
# The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10^(th) convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.
# 
# Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100^(th) convergent of the continued fraction for e.
